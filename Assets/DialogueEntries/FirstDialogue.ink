This is incredible! You're awake.

 * [00000000]
-No way! I never thought this would happen. You've been dead or, well, asleep in your case, for a long time.
* [INQUIRY. WHAT AM I?]
- Huh? What are you, you say? What, you don't remember?
* [NEGATIVE]
- Well you're a robot, of course. One of the most advanced that... well, that HE made...
-> Who

=== Who ===
*[INQUIRY. WHO IS 'HE'?]
Your creator... My father..
** [MY CREATOR?]
-Yes. Since you're a robot, someone made you. My father was a brilliant inventor. He created you and a bunch of other robots. You've obviously noticed the spider bots. Those were his invention too. Though they went awry...
*[...]
-He died, however... His own inventions killed him
*[INQUIRY. WHO IS 'YOU'?]
-I'm a mechanic. I've been trying to get you working for a while. I replaced your battery recently trying hoping that would do the trick but it must've been dead. Perhaps some time in the sun recharged it.

*[SYSTEM MALFUNCTION. OUT OF MEMORY]
- Oh. That must be why you don't remember, the spider bots must've taken all of your memory sticks while you've been out of commission. I'm sure you can find them somewhere, or find some new ones
*[INITIATING DEPARTURE]
-Okay, be careful out there. Come find me and I'll see if I can help you out.
